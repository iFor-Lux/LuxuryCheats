1. Before performing any code modifications or planning, read [AGENTS.md](file:///C:/Users/Luxury/AndroidStudioProjects/LuxuryCheats/AGENTS.md).
2. Ensure the technical stack (Kotlin, Compose, M3 Expressive) is respected.
3. Verify that the UI philosophy (Premium, Minimalist, Apple-inspired) is maintained.
4. Check the architecture rules (MVVM per screen) before adding logic.
5. Record milestones in [PROJECT_MEMORY.md](file:///C:/Users/Luxury/AndroidStudioProjects/LuxuryCheats/PROJECT_MEMORY.md).
6. Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](file:///C:/Users/Luxury/AndroidStudioProjects/LuxuryCheats/ARCHITECTURE.md) when changing file structure.
